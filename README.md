NativeDoc
-----------------------------------------------
NativeDoc is a source code documentation tool for LiveCode.

NativeDoc enables you to browse or generate a documentation from your source code. 

The documentation is extracted directly from the scripts and is directly browsable within the LiveCode IDE. 
Review, search and navigate through your documentation with NativeDoc.

# How to get started?

Download the repository, and extract it to your LiveCode extension folder.

You can locate the user plugins folder by doing so:
1. Open LiveCode preferences
2. In the Files & Memory preferences pane you can find the full path to the User Extensions folder. 
3. Open this folder in your system file browser.
4. If it doesn't exists, create a **"Plugins"** subfolder.
5. Extract NativeDoc into the **"Plugins"** subfolder.
6. Start LiveCode and the NativeGeometry plugin window will be displayed.

**Make sure that "rev_NativeDoc_Launcher.rev" file is at the root of the Plugins folder, LiveCode will automatically execute this file that will load NativeDoc.**

# Documentation

Once NativeDoc is opened, click "Help Center".

# Tests

NativeDoc doesn't have an automated test suite. For each release a set of manual tests cases need to be executed.

Before a push request can be made, you will have to perform manual tests with NativeDoc, and mark them as you didn't introduced a regression.

# How to contribute?

The workflow is a typical git workflow, where contributors fork the [dagirard/NativeDoc](https://github.com/dagirard/NativeDoc) repository, make their changes on a branch, and then submit a pull request.

**Note:** Before commit, you must run `"NativeDoc.res\Devel\NativeDocCleaner.rev"` in order to clean up development variables.
